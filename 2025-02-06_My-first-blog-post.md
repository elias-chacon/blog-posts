## Celebrating 45 Years: My Professional Journey

As I celebrate my 45th birthday today, I'm reflecting on my career that spans over two decades in software development, contributing to building and enhancing systems across various industries, from finance and government to e-commerce and media.

I vividly remember, as if it were yesterday, creating interactive RIA (Rich Internet Applications) software for the Uberlandia City Hall using Macromedia Flash and JavaScript in 2004.

This knowledge led me to develop an innovative audio and video streaming chat platform for a virtual dating project in 2006. As time progressed, I delved deeper into technology, fighting battles on many different fronts.

For ten years, starting in 2005, I developed with PHP and advanced my career in e-commerce from 2012 to 2016. I was living in São Paulo in that period and went back to Uberlandia.

A new chapter began when I returned to my hometown, Brasília, in 2016. There, I transitioned to working exclusively with Java and Spring Boot, alongside the newly released Angular 2 framework.  I led mission-critical government projects where failure wasn't an option. I managed large government projects with tight deadlines, handling direct client interactions delivering under intense pressure.

My expertise grew as I architected solutions for Brazil's most prestigious institutions including the Ministry of Cities, CGU, MP (Public Ministry), and Federal Police, working on projects ranging from simple applications to complex microservices architectures adding new dimensions to my technical skills.

This track record opened doors internationally, leading me to Portugal in 2021. There I collaborated on projects with Italy and the United Kingdom not only enhancing my technical capabilities but also developing the cross-cultural communication skills essential in today's global tech landscape.

Now back in Brazil, I look back at a career that has consistently pushed boundaries and opened new possibilities. I've positively impacted and influenced many people within my professional and personal networks. Despite the years that have passed, I maintain the same enthusiasm for growth and professional development, always looking forward to new challenges and opportunities.

This journey has shaped me into who I am today - a seasoned professional with a passion for technology and a commitment to continuous learning and excellence in software development.
