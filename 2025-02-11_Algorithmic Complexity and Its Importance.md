## Algorithmic Complexity and Its Importance

The performance of a system can have a massive impact on your business. Poorly optimized applications not only slow down operations but can also drive away users and increase infrastructure costs. Simply scaling an inefficient system won’t solve the problem in the long run—it will only make it worse.

But why does this happen?

Rushed development, tight deadlines, and a lack of thorough testing all contribute to performance issues. However, one critical factor often overlooked is **algorithmic complexity analysis**.

### What is Algorithmic Complexity?

Algorithmic complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space. It is measured using well-known notations:

- **Big O (O):** Worst-case scenario
- **Big Omega (Ω):** Best-case scenario
- **Big Theta (Θ):** Average-case complexity

I’m not here to dive deep into the mathematical metrics behind these notations. What’s crucial for developers to understand is that **Big O complexity, in particular, plays a key role in system performance**.

When I mentioned "lack of care in development," I was referring to developers who neglect to analyze algorithmic complexity. Writing code that merely works is not enough. -it needs to be optimized for efficiency.

From personal experience, in technical interviews where I had to complete practical coding tests, some interviewers specifically asked for an **algorithmic complexity analysis**.

Companies are looking for developers who **care about code quality and performance**. If you want to stand out, mastering algorithmic complexity is not optional... -it’s essential.
